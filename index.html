            <h3>Things you should know</h3>
                <p id="health-sense"><strong>1</strong> A maximum 15% Health Sense discount applies to non-smokers meeting the BMI criteria that hold 4 benefit types (Life; Critical Illness; TPD and Income Protection (IP)) and meeting minimum sum insured amounts for all benefit types. Lower discounts will apply for other benefit combinations and smokers. More information is available on request from TAL.<br>Assumes the policy owner makes no changes to the policy, benefit types or amounts, and that the policy or any benefits have not ended (e.g after payment of a claim or the expiry of a benefit).<br>For customers with loadings, the Health Sense discounts apply to premiums including loadings (except loadings applied on a per-mille basis) and apply to Life Insurance, TPD Insurance and Critical Illness Insurance benefits only. Where a per-mille loading has been applied, the discount will not apply on additional premium resulting from the per-mille loading (an example of a per mille loading is $5.00 extra premium per $1,000 sum insured). Health Sense discounts only apply to Life Insurance, TPD Insurance and Critical Illness Insurance benefits only. Please contact TAL for a pre-assessment or if you wish to check the loading basis (for Health Sense and Health Sense Plus eligibility) for any client.</p>
